# PiNAS

## Description

PiNAS is a 3D printed compact NAS enclosure based on Raspberry Pi and up to two SATA HDD/SSD units connected to the Raspberry Pi via SATA to USB converter.

Software-wise it runs on Raspbian and Samba/FTP/anything you like. Power supply can be provided using a 12V 5A external PSU that will power the +12V lines of HDD/SSD drives.
+5V power supply can be provided using a small buck converter such as the DC DC Step Down MP1584 that can provide up to 3A of current, enough to power the Raspberry Pi and the two disk units.


## 3D components

All parts should be printed using:

- PLA filament
- 3 walls
- 0.1mm layer height
- 15% infill
- print plate adhesion raft if needed

The 'Raspberry Pi 2 plate.stl' model is suitable for a Raspberry Pi 2. A Raspberry Pi 4 version will be added here soon.
